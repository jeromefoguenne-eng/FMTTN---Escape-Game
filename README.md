**Solve CS puzzles. Beat the clock. Escape with your code.**

## What is CodeEscape??

CodeEscape is a CS-themed escape room built as a full-stack web app. Pick a topic track — Algorithms, ML/AI, Cybersecurity, Databases, Networks, or a dozen more — then race through 10 questions before the clock hits zero. Play solo or build a team of up to 6, with any open slot fillable by an AI agent teammate.

The twist: your AI agent isn't just a hint button. Each of the four agent personalities responds differently based on your wrong answer, how long you've been stuck, and how much time is left. ARIA encourages without spoiling. BYTE walks you through it step by step. SIGMA asks Socratic questions. ZAP keeps it casual. You choose how you want to be helped.

There are two ways to compete. **Team Mode** keeps everyone moving together — the game advances when all players answer or time runs out, and a live sidebar shows who's still thinking. **Race Mode** flips it individual — a live leaderboard shifts as players answer, and speed bonuses reward decisiveness.

## Background

CodeEscape started as a ground-up rebuild of an earlier static HTML/CSS/JS event registration page (CodeScape v1) into a production-grade, full-stack Next.js application. The rebuild introduced real interactive gameplay, a live database, AI integration, real-time team sync, and an adaptive difficulty engine — none of which existed in v1.

---

## Features

### Gameplay
- **12+ CS topic tracks**: Algorithms & Data Structures, Computational Theory, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Operating Systems, Databases, Networks, Computer Architecture, and more — plus a Random Mix wildcard
- **240+ questions** across all tracks; each session draws 10 curated questions from a pool of 20+ per track
- **Two game modes**: Team Mode (collaborative, timer-driven) and Race Mode (individual leaderboard, speed bonuses)
- **Solo or team play**: jump in alone or build a team of up to 6 (human + AI slots)
- **Timed stages** with a color-coded countdown bar (cyan → amber → red as time runs low)
- **Score system** with points weighted by speed and correctness

### AI Agent System
Four distinct AI teammate personalities, each powered by `claude-sonnet-4-6`:

| Agent | Personality | Style |
|---|---|---|
| ARIA 💙 | Supportive | Validates thinking, builds confidence, never gives answers |
| BYTE 🟡 | Spoon Feeder | Step-by-step micro-hints, reveals approach after 3 failures |
| SIGMA ⚪ | Supervisor | Socratic questions only, time complexity focus, professional |
| ZAP ⚡ | Friendly | Casual analogies, light humor, still genuinely helpful |

- Real-time streaming chat with each agent (token-by-token display)
- Agents receive full context: puzzle type, player's current wrong answer, hints already given, and time remaining
- Smart hint engine: after a wrong submission, Claude analyzes the *specific* wrong answer and generates a targeted hint — not a generic one

### Game Modes

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Team Mode** 🤝 | Everyone attempts every question at their own pace. A live sidebar shows who's done vs. still thinking. The game advances when everyone answers — or time runs out. Score is shared. |
| **Race Mode** ⚡ | Every player for themselves. Individual leaderboard updates live as players answer. Speed bonus: answering earlier earns more base points. Correct answers score much higher, but wrong-but-fast still scores. |

### Solo Play
Players can launch a solo session without forming a team. Pick a track, choose an AI agent companion, and jump straight into the game — no lobby, no invite link needed.

### Team Formation
- Magic link authentication via Supabase Auth (no passwords)
- Create a team, pick a game mode, and configure each slot: invite a human via link, or assign an AI agent
- Real-time lobby with Supabase Realtime — slot fills appear instantly across all browsers
- Host-only "Start Game" control

### Adaptive Difficulty (ML)
- Item Response Theory (IRT) model estimates each player's skill level (θ) from their performance
- θ updates after every puzzle: correct + fast → θ increases; slow + many hints → θ decreases
- Next puzzle selection is matched to current θ — struggling players get easier puzzles, fast players get harder ones

### Analytics Dashboard
- Aggregated stats across all sessions: avg attempts per puzzle, hint usage by stage, skill distribution, agent personality popularity
- Recharts bar charts and radar charts with cyberpunk color palette

### Security
- Zod validation on every API route input
- Upstash Redis rate limiting: 10 req/min on agent chat, 30/min on puzzle submit, 5/min on team create
- CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, and other security headers
- Puzzle answers never sent to the client — validation runs server-side only

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The entire application is a single Next.js 16 App Router project deployed to Vercel. There is no separate backend server — all API logic lives in Next.js Route Handlers under `src/app/api/`.

```

├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx                # Landing page (hero, game modes, how it works, agents)

```

### Notable Challenges Overcome

**AI SDK v6 breaking changes** — The `ai` package completely changed its API in v6. Solved by reading type declaration files directly and building a custom streaming component using raw `fetch` + `ReadableStream` instead of fighting the new SDK hooks.

**Next.js 16 API changes** — `params` in dynamic route segments became a `Promise` requiring `use(params)` to unwrap. Middleware was also renamed to "proxy" (`middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`).

**Supabase client/server split** — A single file importing `next/headers` caused client component build failures. Fixed with a lazy browser-safe singleton and a separate server-only module.

**Zod v4 record type** — `z.record(valueType)` was removed in Zod v4. Now requires both key and value: `z.record(z.string(), z.string())`.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- **Full-stack Next.js App Router** — server components, client components, Route Handlers, and when each is appropriate
- **Streaming AI responses** — implemented token-by-token streaming from Claude using `ReadableStream` + `TextDecoder` at the HTTP level
- **Real-time with Supabase** — `postgres_changes` subscriptions for live lobby and game-state updates without polling
- **Item Response Theory** — implemented a psychometric model in TypeScript to estimate ability from performance
- **Game mode design** — building two fundamentally different multiplayer dynamics (collaborative vs. competitive) on the same shared question engine
- **Production debugging** — read `.d.ts` declaration files to understand breaking API changes when documentation lags behind releases
- Navigating 6 simultaneous breaking API changes across Next.js 16, AI SDK v6, Zod v4, and Supabase SSR

---

## Project Rationale

The escape room format reframes CS problem-solving as exploration rather than evaluation. The collaborative pressure of a timed room with teammates feels like a game rather than a test.

The AI agent system was the most interesting part to build. Four distinct personalities let a player choose *how* they want to be helped, not just whether they want a hint. BYTE is for someone who's lost; SIGMA is for someone who wants to be pushed. The way a hint is delivered matters as much as what the hint says.

---

## Future Development

- **More tracks** — deeper dives into specific areas (operating systems internals, distributed systems, security CTF-style challenges)
- **Global leaderboard** — Elo-style ratings across solo and team sessions
- **Hint replay** — after session completion, replay the agent conversation that helped you
- **Custom puzzle builder** — let instructors create puzzle sets for specific courses
- **OAuth login** — GitHub/Google alongside magic link
- **Mobile layout polish** — game page sidebar on small screens

---

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project (free tier works)
- An [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) API key
- An [Upstash](https://upstash.com) Redis database (free tier works)

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SameeraaGKan/CodeScape_the_Algorithm_escape_room.git
cd CodeScape_the_Algorithm_escape_room
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase — from your Supabase project Settings > API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...

# Supabase Postgres — Settings > Database > Connection string
# NOTE: URL-encode special characters in your password 
DATABASE_URL=...

# Anthropic Claude API — console.anthropic.com > API Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# Upstash Redis — upstash.com > Redis > Create Database > REST API section
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
```

### 3. Push the database schema
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. Enable Supabase Realtime
Dashboard → **Database** → **Replication** → enable for `teams` and `game_sessions`

### 5. Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Deploying to Vercel
Push to GitHub, import at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com), add all environment variables under Settings → Environment Variables, and deploy. Next.js deploys with zero config.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Best places to contribute:

- **New puzzles** — add to `src/lib/puzzles/data/puzzles.ts`, all 4 puzzle types already supported
- **Agent personality tuning** — `src/lib/ai/personalities.ts`
- **Answer validation edge cases** — `src/lib/puzzles/validator.ts`
- **Mobile layout polish** — the game page sidebar on small screens

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-thing
npx tsc --noEmit   # verify types pass
# open a pull request
```

Please do not commit `.env.local` or any API keys.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Upstash warnings during build** — non-fatal, disappear once env vars are set

**Magic link not arriving** — check Supabase Auth logs; verify email provider is configured

**Agent chat not responding** — verify API is set (no surrounding quotes needed)
